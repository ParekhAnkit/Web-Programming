            <h2> Graduate School</h2>
            <p > 
                I am doing my Master's in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology.<br>
                I am also doing my graduate certification in Business Intelligence and Analytics.<br>
                It is a great college to study. The curriculum is very flexible and large, touching all aspects of latest technlogies and studies.
                The faculty is very good everyone is helping and quite knowledgeable.<br>
                My favorite classes are Web Programming and Web Analytics because both these classes focuses on latest technologies and web and also analytics which are my fields of interest.<br>
                One of my most memorable time at Stevens was the Holi celebration because of many reasons. One of the biggest reason was I was missing my home and was surprised to see such an amazing celebration of my favorite festival here in United States.
                Similar to India all the of my friends were dressed in white and there were colors and water available for us too play with and music for dancing.I also made a few new friends. It was very special day for me as it made me like I am at home also our campus is one the best things about Stevens, playing holi with friends with music and food on a bright day on the edge of hudson river was an unforgettable expereince.

            <h2> Undergraduate School</h2>
            <p>
                I did my undergraduation from St. Francis Institute of Technology(SFIT) - Mumbai University in Mumbai India.<br>
                I completed my Bachelor's in Information Technology in May 2016 with distinction<br>
                Over the course of four years I have done many subjects but there three classes I liked the most and they were Basics of Electrical and Electronics, Engineering Drawing and Software Project Management. All of these subjects were different from other IT data mining or coding subjects<br>
                One of my most memorable memory at SFIT was the annual college Fest Iris in my thrid year where I was a major part of the sports and Oranganization committee. Especailly at end of the day of the Fest when everything went well and hardwork and efforts of 15 days were successful, it felt really good when all the teachers commeded me and my team.

            <h2> High School</h2>
            <p>
                I completed my high school studies from Shri T.P Bhatia College of Science in Mumbai, India.  .<br>
                I did my high school graudation in Science with Computer Science as my Concentration.<br>
                My favorite class was Introduction to Computer Science and Programming beacuse this is subject where I decided I will pursuing a technical field with Programming and coding being an important part of such a field<br>
                A memorable memory from my time in this school was our Inter- College Football Competition. I was made the captain of our team and for the first time. We had really a bad start with no wins in the first three games.
                I was the striker in the team and was not in a good form with just one goal in the three matches. We needed to win against the group leaders and with a margin of 6 goals to qualify and no one gave us a chance. But somehow we won the match with the score line of 7-1 with me scoring the a hatrick and the final decisive goal in the dying minutes.
                Later in the coming weeks we went on to win this competiton with me finishing as the top scorer with 12 goals in our divivsion.
